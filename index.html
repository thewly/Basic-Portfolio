                    My professional journey is unconventional, but grounded in practical, on-the-job experience. 
                    I am a native Texan who's also lived & worked in Idaho, Utah, California, Alabama & Georgia. 
                    Professionally I have worked in some aspect of design for 7 years in the Dallas, TX area. 
                    With an English degree, my first job out of university was as a how-to copywriter for a children's face 
                    paint manufacturer.
                    <br /><br />
                    This led to laying out their books & eventually designing their blister cards, 
                    brochures, tooling & trade-show booth signage. 2 years ago I moved to an almost purely digital role working for an online 
                    lingerie retailer designing their digital marketing content. I worked my way up from 
                    production artist to senior graphic designer & along the way added Adobe certification 
                    in Photoshop & After Effects as well as becoming a Certified Digital Marketer through 
                    the American Marketing Association.
                    <br /><br />
                    It was with this employer I began working closely with developers & became 
                    interested in learning how to implement the prototypes & webpages that I was designing. 
                    My boss recommended a program offered through SMU, which is eventually the option I chose.

                    This is a little bit about me. I grew up in Flower Mound Texas. I went to school in Idaho & Utah where I met my wife Lana. Aside from Texas, Idaho & Utah, I have also lived in Georgia, Alabama & California.
                    <br />
                    The first company I worked for was a children's face paint manufacturer. My degree is in English & my first professional responsibility was to write face painting how-to books. This led to laying out these books. Over time I designed packaging & branded the new line & handled all design needs.
                    <br />
                    After 5 years with them I moved to a purely digital role where I designed emails, lookbooks & website pages.
